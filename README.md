Pawesome is a website that seeks to collaborate with various animal shelters in Malaysia dedicated to the welfare and protection of animals. 
The website is a collection of ten HTML files each with its own purpose.

This project was a group assignment of the Web Fundamentals subject I took for my Computer Science degree. I coded two of the ten HTML files (donate.html & pawesome_diaries.html).
